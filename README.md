# physics-event-classifier
Random Forest classifier for simulated particle physics events using Python and scikit-learn.

## Overview
This project implements a **machine learning classifier** to distinguish between **signal and background events** in a simulated particle physics dataset.  
It demonstrates how computational methods and AI techniques can be applied to **data analysis in high-energy physics**, a key skill for research environments like CERN.

## Features
- Generates synthetic physics-like dataset
- Splits data into training and testing sets
- Trains a **Random Forest classifier**
- Evaluates model accuracy
- Visualizes results using a confusion matrix

## Scientific Background
High-energy physics experiments generate vast datasets containing both **signal** (interesting events) and **background** (noise).  
Machine learning techniques like Random Forests are used to classify events, optimize detection, and reduce false positives.  
This project provides hands-on experience with **data preprocessing, training, evaluation, and visualization** — all relevant for computational physics research.

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3**
- **scikit-learn** – for machine learning algorithms
- **Matplotlib** – for visualization
